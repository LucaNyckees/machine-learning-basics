# Machine Learning (CS-433)
## The Higgs Boson Project

### Team members
Raphaël Mirallié
Luca Nyckees
Clarisse Schumer

### Requirements
* `Numpy`
* `Matplotlib`

### Our files

* `ML_Project1/Projet/submission` contains a list of `.csv`submission files, consisting of predictions on the given dataset.
* `ML_Project1/Projet/scripts`contains some `.py` files, including the following :
  - `helper_implementations.py`, defining the basic tools used in...
  - `implementations.py`, where the main machine learning algorithms are implemented,
  - `cleaning_data.py`, where we treat the data (splitting methods, standardization, taking outliers into account),
  - `cross_validation.py`, where we set some important cross-validation methods to optimize the choice of hyperparameters.
  - Some notebooks found at the extension `ML_Project1/Projet/scripts/.ipynb_checkpoints`, where all implemented methods are put to use and the producing of the prediction files takes place.
